# Homework 4 Files

Reference TeX files are from [Tyler Akidau](https://github.com/takidau/animations).

Note that the files are modified to produce the correct animation frames **ONLY** for those cases specified in Homework 4. Other irrelevant commands and comments in the [`diagrams.tex`](./diagrams.tex) file might not be accurate since they are not of importance with respect to Homework 4.

   - **True**
   - False
2. Suppose you want to accelerate a machine learning task with some customized TensorFlow operations. It is suitable for TPU acceleration.
   - True
   - **False**
3. Deploying services on more equal-sized servers is regarded as horizontal scaling.
   - **True**
   - False
4. Which of the following AWS service will push content close to the user location?
   - A. AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
   - B. CloudWatch
   - **C. AWS CloudFront**
   - D. Elastic Container Services (ECS)
5. Which of the following statements are true for the Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) in Spark?
   - [x] A. Data stored in an RDD is read-only.
   - [x] B. An RDD stores immediate data in the memory (RAM) for fast access.
   - [ ] C. In RDD, a map() function will immediately apply the function you defined to each element once you invoke it.
   - [x] D. Spark transformation operators will create new RDD(s) from existing RDDs.
6. Which of the following statements are true for HDFS?
   - [x] A. It is suitable for the write-once-read-many scenario.
   - [ ] B. It is a POSIX file system.
   - [x] C. HDFS is not efficient if the size of the file is small, say 1MB.
   - [x] D. Data pushed to the HDFS will be first blocked and replicated before they are stored.
7. Which of the following statement is true about a scalable architecture?
   - [x] A. A component should have a single function if possible.
   - [ ] B. A component should keep its own data and status.
   - [ ] C. Asynchronous processing is not scalable because it will introduce more delays.
   - [x] D. Buffering data between two signal processing blocks can avoid data loss due to unmatched signal processing speed.
